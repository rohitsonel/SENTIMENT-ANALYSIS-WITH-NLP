#DESCRIPTION OF TASK 2

This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques combined with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The primary goal is to classify textual data — such as customer reviews, tweets, or feedback — into sentiment categories like positive, negative, or neutral. This kind of classification helps businesses, organizations, and researchers gauge public opinion, enhance customer experience, and make informed decisions.
The dataset used in this project typically contains a collection of text entries (e.g., movie reviews or tweets) along with their corresponding sentiment labels. The project begins with preprocessing the raw text data using essential NLP steps. The preprocessing phase includes converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, and eliminating special characters. A crucial part of this step is stopword removal, which is handled using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library. Stopwords such as “the”, “is”, “and”, etc., are common in English but provide little value in sentiment analysis. Removing them helps in reducing noise and improving model accuracy.
Tokenization is then performed to split text into individual words or tokens. Stemming or lemmatization is optionally used to convert words into their base or root form. After preprocessing, the cleaned text data is converted into numerical format using methods like Bag-of-Words (BoW) or Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), which create feature vectors from the textual data.
These feature vectors are then used to train a machine learning model. Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) are typically employed for classification. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained on the training set. It is then evaluated using the test set through metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
The model’s output can be visualized using confusion matrices and word clouds to show the most frequent terms associated with each sentiment. Moreover, the system can be integrated with web or mobile applications for real-time sentiment monitoring.
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of NLP and ML in understanding human emotions through text. It also highlights how combining preprocessing techniques (like NLTK’s stopword filtering) with robust classifiers can build efficient, scalable sentiment analysis tools. This has real-world applications in fields like marketing, customer service, politics, and public health surveillance.
